= Jdk 8 test build

This build is meant to trivially test that a project running jdk 8 can use
the gradle plugin. It should be compiled/run only with jdk 8. It is not expected to
function properly until the main build has deployed to mavenLocal. This is not ideal
for automation, and so this may change when github actions are enabled.
